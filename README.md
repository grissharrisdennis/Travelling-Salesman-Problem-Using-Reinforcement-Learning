# Travelling-Salesman-Problem-Using-Reinforcement-Learning
Created a reinforcement agent  to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem and used pygame to visualize the training.

This project implements a Q-learning agent to solve the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The agent is trained to find the shortest route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting point, optimizing the total distance traveled. The project uses the Pygame framework to visualize the agentâ€™s learning process in real-time.

## Introduction
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an optimization problem where the objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city. This project leverages reinforcement learning, specifically the Q-learning algorithm, to address this problem by training an agent to learn the optimal path.

## Technologies Used
### Programming Language : Python
### Visualization Framework: Pygame
### Machine Learning Concept: Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning)

## How It Works
Q-learning Agent: The agent is trained using the Q-learning algorithm to find the optimal route.
Reward System: The reward is set as the negative distance between cities, encouraging the agent to minimize the total travel distance.
Installation
Visualization: Pygame is used to render the cities, paths, and the learning process, allowing you to see how the agent improves over time.

To run this project locally, follow these steps:
### Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/grissharrisdennis/Travelling-Salesman-Problem-Using-Reinforcement-Learning.git

cd Travelling-Salesman-Problem-Using-Reinforcement-Learning

### Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
